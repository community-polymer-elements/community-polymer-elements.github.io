Please note that this attribute is only valid in combination with the\nplus.login scope (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login).\n\nThe `offline` attribute allows you to get an auth code which your server can\nredeem for an offline access token\n(https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow).\n\nUse label properties to customize prompts.\n\nThe button can be styled in using the `height`, `width`, and `theme` attributes.\nThese attributes help you follow the Google+ Sign-In button branding guidelines\n(https://developers.google.com/+/branding-guidelines).\n\nThe `google-signin-success` event is triggered when a user successfully authenticates\nand `google-signed-out` is triggered when user signs out.\nYou can also use `isAuthorized` attribute to observe user's authentication state.\n\nAdditional events, such as `google-signout-attempted` are\ntriggered when the user attempts to sign-out and successfully signs out.\n\nWhen requesting offline access, the `google-signin-offline-success` event is\ntriggered when the user successfully consents with offline support.\n\nThe `google-signin-necessary` event is fired when scopes requested via\ngoogle-signin-aware elements require additional user permissions.\n\n#### Testing\n\nBy default, the demo accompanying this element is setup to work on localhost with\nport 8080. That said, you *should* update the `clientId` to your own one for\nany apps you're building. See the Google Developers Console\n(https://console.developers.google.com) for more info.\n\n","events":[{"desc":"\nFired when the user is signed-out.\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired when the user is signed-out.\n","tags":[{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signed-out"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired when the user is signed-out.\n     * @event google-signed-out\n     "},"name":"google-signed-out","params":[]},{"desc":"\nFired when this scope is not authorized\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired when this scope is not authorized\n","tags":[{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signin-aware-signed-out"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired when this scope is not authorized\n     * @event google-signin-aware-signed-out\n     "},"name":"google-signin-aware-signed-out","params":[]},{"desc":"\nFired when signed in, and scope has been authorized\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired when signed in, and scope has been authorized\n","tags":[{"tag":"param","type":"Object","name":"result","description":"Authorization result."},{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signin-aware-success"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired when signed in, and scope has been authorized\n     * @param {Object} result Authorization result.\n     * @event google-signin-aware-success\n     "},"name":"google-signin-aware-success","params":[{"type":"Object","desc":"Authorization result.","name":"result"}]},{"desc":"\nFired if user requires additional authorization\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired if user requires additional authorization\n","tags":[{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signin-necessary"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired if user requires additional authorization\n     * @event google-signin-necessary\n     "},"name":"google-signin-necessary","params":[]},{"desc":"\nFired when an offline authorization is successful.\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired when an offline authorization is successful.\n","tags":[{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signin-offline-success"},{"tag":"param","type":"Object","name":"detail","description":null},{"tag":"param","type":"string","name":"detail.code","description":"The one-time authorization code from Google.\n    Your application can exchange this for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired when an offline authorization is successful.\n     * @event google-signin-offline-success\n     * @param {Object} detail\n     * @param {string} detail.code The one-time authorization code from Google.\n     *     Your application can exchange this for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`\n     "},"name":"google-signin-offline-success","params":[{"type":"Object","desc":null,"name":"detail"},{"type":"string","desc":"The one-time authorization code from Google.\n    Your application can exchange this for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`","name":"detail.code"}]},{"desc":"\nFired when user is signed in.\nYou can use auth2 api to retrieve current user: `gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().currentUser.get();`\n","jsdoc":{"description":"\nFired when user is signed in.\nYou can use auth2 api to retrieve current user: `gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().currentUser.get();`\n","tags":[{"tag":"event","type":null,"description":"google-signin-success"}],"orig":"*\n     * Fired when user is signed in.\n     * You can use auth2 api to retrieve current user: `gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().currentUser.get();`\n     * @event google-signin-success\n     "},"name":"google-signin-success","params":[]}],"properties":[{"name":"appPackageName","type":"String","desc":"\nApp package name for android over-the-air installs.\nSee the relevant [docs](https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/android-app-installs)\n         ","published":true,"default":""},{"name":"brand","type":"String","desc":"\nThe brand being used for logo and styling.\n\n","published":true,"default":"'google'","jsdoc":{"tags":[{"tag":"default","type":null,"description":"'google'"}]}},{"name":"clientId","type":"String","desc":"\na Google Developers clientId reference\n         ","published":true,"default":""},{"name":"cookiePolicy","type":"String","desc":"\nThe cookie policy defines what URIs have access to the session cookie\nremembering the user's sign-in state.\nSee the relevant [docs](https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/reference#determining_a_value_for_cookie_policy) for more information.\n\n","published":true,"default":"'single_host_origin'","jsdoc":{"tags":[{"tag":"default","type":null,"description":"'single_host_origin'"}]}},{"name":"fill","type":"Boolean","desc":"\nBy default the ripple expands to fill the button.
